### Zypst Devlopment @Github
Zypst development is now streamlined using Github; amazing collaboration tools, time and task management and an efficient workflow.
The Zypst development team is required to use Github for development to ensure fair and fast developemnt.

### What is this project?
This is Zypst development team's main way to communicate and develop Skript scripts, code named "Zypst-development".

### What language are we using and why?
We are using a scripting language named "Skript" which is based upon Java, it's extremely easy to use and lightweight.

### How the git workflow works?
1) Think of a git repositery basically as a storage device with a main folde named "zypst-development" (project's name).

2) Inside the main folder (zypst-development) there is another folder called "master", this is where the project's main files stay, these files will be used for the final product. This folder is known as the "Master Branch" (A "Branch" is a folder in the main folder ("zypst-development"). 

3) Let's say you wanted to change to the code, or had an idea, you would create a secondary "branch" from the "master branch". A secondary branch will basically copy everything from the master branch put it into itself. You are free to edit code as you wish, when ever you edit the code, you will make a "commit". A commit is a snapchat of a edit you made to your code in your branch. You can use it to re-visit, kind of like a undo. 

4) After you are happy with your edits, you will make a "pull request", which is basically a request to merge. Once people review your code, a lead developer can decide weather to accept you're change or not. If accepted, your branch will be merged.

> **Note:** Only admins can accept pull requests and edit the master branch.
